<h2 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Why Dagne Unisex?</h2>

<h5 style="padding-bottom: 20px;"> What Defines a Unisex Bag?</h5>

<p>Versatility. Minimalism. High-quality material. Our favorite qualities of Dagne’s unisex bags. With sleek lines and genius storage, you simply pick your favorite color (or two) and move on with your life. No frills. No-fuss. Just Dagne.

</p>
<h5 style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 10px;"> Are There Different Kinds of Gender-Neutral Bags?</h5>
<p>Different people like different things and have different needs. That’s why we offer genderless bags in different styles). The Landon Carryall is a unisex bag that comes in five different sizes. The Extra Small is perfect for errands and the Extra Large is perfect for a weekend away. Either way, there’s a Landon that’s perfect for you.</p>
<p>Like keeping things hands-free? The Dakota neoprene backpack is for you. A unisex bag in three sizes (if you want space for your laptop, opt for the Medium or Large),  there’s a choice for everyone. On or off the grid, this genderless bag is perfect for slinging over your shoulder and heading out to do whatever you want to do.</p>
 <p>The Ace Fanny Pack is the belt bag of the 21st century (no offense to the 80s or anything). This unisex belt bag clips around your waist or slings around your body for timeless, effortless style. With this androgynous bag, it’s impossible not to ace this look. </p> 
 <p>A gender-neutral bag isn’t just for style (although that sure helps), it’s also for practicality. The Hunter Toiletry Bag is a weekend trip toiletry bag but it works just as well for a quick refresh at work. The Hunter is able to fit everything anyone might need. Available in two sizes, this unisex bag is perfect for over-packers, under-packers, and everyone in between. </p>
 <p>Adults deserve to have cute lunch boxes too. The Axel is an insulated gender-neutral bag that will keep your things chill (or warm) and spill-free. Got a kid who wants to stand out during lunchtime but isn’t into the whole superhero lunchbox thing? This unisex bag works for them, as well. </p>
 <p>Raise your hand if you’re sick of tangled wires. Well, we can’t see if your hand is raised but if it is, say hello to your new favorite gender-neutral travel tech organizer. The Arlo Tech Organizer fits inside any of our larger Dagne Bags, making organizing a cinch. Never play the untangling game again with this genderless bag.

 </p>
 <p>Wouldn’t it be nice to have a gender-neutral card case that’s actually card case size? Dagne’s Card Case is the best place to store cards when you’re not feeling full-sized wallet vibes. This androgynous bag is perfect for minimalists who just want to get up and go without any unnecessary bulk.</p>
 <p>Hands-free. On-the-go. Easy-peasy. The Nova is a unisex sling bag that makes life a little less chaotic. Made from 7 recycled bottles, you can feel good about taking Nova with you wherever you go because this gender-neutral sling bag is making Mama Earth a little happier. </p>
 <p>When it comes to toiletries, it’s good to keep them all in one place. The Mila pouch is the unisex toiletry organizer bag for anybody in your life (including yourself). Toothbrush, toothpaste, skincare routine, beauty essentials. It's a gender-neutral bag for all. </p>
 <p>A waterproof unisex bag that’s durable enough for the great outdoors and is fashionable for everybody? Hello, Rae. This roll-top dry bag is perfect for all sorts of adventures. Bring this genderless bag to the beach or the pool and never worry about your essentials getting sandy or soaked. 

 </p>
 <p>On the go and always forgetting that one thing you swore you wouldn’t forget? Us too. That’s why we designed a genderless bag for all your essentials. The Skye Essentials Pouch is a unisex bag for everybody. Carry it in your hand or slip it into one of our bigger bags, this essential neoprene pouch will make sure you never leave without your keys, credit cards, or phone ever again.

 </p>
 <p>Being better to the Earth is something everybody can get behind. The Vida Tote makes it a little easier. Made of 100% organic cotton, this all-purpose unisex tote bag is as good for groceries as it is for beach days, with space for everything in between. Did we mention pockets? Because yeah, this genderless bag has pockets for days.

 </p>
 <p>Made of 100% organic cotton, the Pacific tote is a unisex bag that’s got pockets on pockets. Great for work with space to fit most 13” laptops and perfect for a picnic in the park with room for a bottle of wine (okay, maybe two) and all the charcuterie board faves. Get a genderless tote bag that can fit it all.</p>
 <p>Speaking of picnics, we all want to keep our bevvies cold. And if you’re looking for a unisex bag that holds a six-pack without shaking up your cans, the Tavi Cooler is for you. Keep your drinks chill with this gender-neutral bag even on the sunniest of days. </p>
 <p>But what about when there’s a baby on board? A good unisex diaper bag doesn't have to scream, “Hey, look at me! I’m a diaper bag!” The Indi doesn’t even have to be a diaper bag, it’s just that cute. This gender-neutral diaper backpack works for everybody, kids or no kids. With extra zippers for easy access and two key leashes, never lose anything ever again.</p>
<p>A unisex bag needs the right accessories. Our carabiner set is a perfect addition to any of Dagne’s gender-neutral bags. Why? It keeps things handy and accessible. </p>
<h5 style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 10px;"> Do Dagne’s Gender-Neutral Bags Have Matching Products?</h5>
<p>Long story short, yes. Long story long, all of Dagne Dover’s unisex bags have other products that perfectly complement them. Coincidentally, you’ll get lots of compliments on all of them. Our curated kits guarantee it. For a day at the beach, the Rae Roll-Top Dry Bag and Vida Cotton Tote bag will keep all your things dry and sand-free. Taking a weekend trip to do some hiking? The Landon Carryall bag and Ace Fanny Pack will be all you need without breaking a sweat (okay, maybe a few drops). The Card Case can be thrown into the Dakota Neoprene Backpack for a hands-free and elevated gender-neutral look. And the Skye Essentials Pouch is an easy fit for the Pacific Tote; just throw it in and go. Looking good is what our androgynous bags are all about. </p>
